# Laravel DDD & CQRS sample by Bejao

This project shows how to implement DDD & CQRS using Laravel Eloquent (Active Record).

This code is extracted from our internal project, so we are already using it.

How to test it
---------------
Is a clean Laravel Install, is not properly configured, although tests are working.

Downloda the project and use Sail to test it: ./vendor/bin/sail up

You can try the tests using ./vendorbin/bash and then php artisan test

Phpstan is also configure to Level 9.
